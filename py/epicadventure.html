<h1>Destination: Windy-Desert</h1>

<h2> Mission Goal: Explore the "Death Zone" in the Windy-Desert </h2>
<p> Everyone in the spaceship has been talking about the "Death Zone" that is located in the middle of the Windy-desert
</p>
<p> Rumors has it that the remains of a mighty dragon has been seen there. Getting one will surely fetch a high price
</p>
<p> I believe the name "Death Zone" was given to this spot because of the strong and ferocious winds that pass through there. Other than
  that, I believe you wont have any trouble traveling there.
</p>
<p> Go and explore the "Death Zone" and report back to me if you find anything there
</p>
<p> Good luck Solider
</p>

<h2>Caution</h2>
</p>
<p> Just as the name suggests, this is not your typical desert.
</p>
<p> Winds here are significantly stronger than winds in your average desert.
</p>
<p> During the nighttime, winds will be extremely strong and dangerous. Getting caught up in one will not end well.
