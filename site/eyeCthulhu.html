<p> Once the Eye of Cthulhu reaches around 3016 hp, it starts to change into its second form. In its second form, it has a much more scarier appearance as its lens are shredded inward into a mouth full of fangs.
    Its attacks are much more faster as it now aggressively dashes towards the player. It no longer spawns Servants of Cthulhu but its damage is increased.
